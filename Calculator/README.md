# Overview

For this project, my goal is to learn about the C++ as this is my first time learning it. This project is a simple command-line calculator written in C++. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and includes error handling for invalid inputs. I hope through this experience I can further enhance my knowledge about C++.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the calculator more user-friendly.
- Implement more complex mathematical functions such as exponentiation and trigonometric operations.
- Enhance the file I/O functionality to support loading and saving more comprehensive calculation histories.
