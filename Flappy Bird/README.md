# Overview

For this game framework module I create a flappy bird inspired game, I am hoping to learn more about the arcade library specifically to further improve my knowledge in Python software. There is a tutorial I found on youtube how to make this game that used pygame library but I found a way to use the arcade library. This game navigate a bird through obstacles by pressing the space button. 

Below is a demonstration video how the game works.

# Development Environment

I've used Python software and the arcade library to finish this game framework project "Flappy Bird".

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Fix the delay scoring sound effects.
* Add a difficulty feature where everytime you pass 10 points it will go faster.
* Better visual for the score, gameover, and restart.
