# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

This is a currency converter web app that I created using the HTML, CSS, and mostly is the javascript since that is the software that I'm not familiar the most. What I want to do in this program is to use the US dollar as a based to exchange it to any currencies that circulates around the world. The puropose for is when we go outside the country, we can know the current exchange rate and also for conveniency. The main thing I want to learn from Javascript is how to use fetch to use the APIs and implement it in the code.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
