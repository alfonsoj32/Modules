# Overview

As a software engineer aiming to deepen my expertise in Rust, I developed a password manager to showcase the Rust language's features and syntax. This project allows users to securely store and retrieve passwords using efficient data structures and object-oriented techniques.

The purpose of this software is to demonstrate my understanding of Rust's syntax and best practices. By implementing this password manager, I focused on learning and applying key Rust concepts, including ownership, references, and the use of collections.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
